# Audio Classification with FastAPI and JavaScript

This project is a web-based application for audio classification using **FastAPI** as the backend and **JavaScript** for the frontend. Users can either **upload** an audio file or **record** audio directly from the browser. The audio file is then sent to the backend for processing, and the predicted label is returned.

## Features

- Upload an audio file for classification
- Record audio directly from the browser
- Audio is processed and resampled to 16kHz
- Uses **PyTorch** and **torchaudio** for deep learning inference
- FastAPI backend to serve the machine learning model
